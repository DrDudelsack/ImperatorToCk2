However, such a gargantuan empire needs an equally massive bureaucracy in order to suistain itself, and we have pushed well beyond the limits of what our bureaucracy can handle, leaving the empire unmanagable, vastly overextended, and on the verge of collapse. In drastic times, drastic decisions must be made, and our best course of action is something that would have been unthinkable generations prior: Split the tagEmpireName in half, with an empire in the east and another in the west.
