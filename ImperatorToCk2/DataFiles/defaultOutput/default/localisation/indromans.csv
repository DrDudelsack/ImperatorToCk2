EVTNAMEireevntsixteen;The Eastern Expedition;x
EVTDESCireevntsixteen;Our caravan of expeditionary troops has been marching nonstop these past few days. Our troops are clearly tired, and the sun is beginning to set. It's about time I gave the order to make camp for the night. My generals are already having sudes set up around the encampment.;x

ireevntsixteen.2;I guess I should learn more about Han dialect...;x

EVTNAMEireevntseventeen;The Eastern Expedition;x
EVTDESCireevntseventeen;As the expedition inches ever closer to the Chinese capital, I've been occupying myself by writing down my own personal thoughts and questions into my journal. Questions that the priests in Romalus would not have allowed me to openly ask. Being able to think freely about the divine, without listening to dogmatic ramblings from our most corrupt preachers, truly a breath of fresh air.;x
EVTDESCireevntseventeen_B;As the expedition inches ever closer to the Chinese capital, I've been occupying myself by learning more about the various foreign tongues and dialects that one encounters while travelling across the silk road. So many different peoples with so many different manners of speech... The world truly is a big place. My eyes have been opened to sheer scale of mankind.;x
EVTDESCireevntseventeen_C;As the expedition inches ever closer to the Chinese capital, I've been occupying myself by playing board games with Julian and his officers.

EVTNAMEireevnteighteen;The Eastern Expedition;x
EVTDESCireevnteighteen;The journey deep into the heart of China has already proven to be one of the greatest decisions of my life. I have not known such a wondrous feeling of personal freedom since before Saegorius first gained dominion over the Viet. Not only that, but me and my men no longer need to fear for the consequences of speaking freely against the eccentricities of our ostensibly genius Imperator.;x
ireevnteighteen.1;I'm starting to wonder about him...;x

EVTNAMEireevntnineteen;The Eastern Expedition;x
EVTDESCireevntnineteen;The farther we get from the Saegorian Empire, the clearer I feel my head becoming. Without the Emperor's mad ramblings, I'm beginning to realise just how ridiculous the original objectives of our western incursion actually were. Surely Saegorius didn't think our horde would maintain enough organization and momentum to thunder itself all the way back to Italia, right?;x
ireevntnineteen.1;That's ridiculous! It's surprising we even got this far.;x

EVTNAMEireevnttwenty;The Eastern Expedition;x
EVTDESCireevnttwenty;Come to think of it... Aside from the admittedly monumentous achievement of politically unifying the disparate and divided Romano-Vieti, Emperor Saegorius has displayed himself to be an unreasonable, and even outright deranged leader of men. He promised to lead us back to Rome and Our Sea, but now he has already settled himself in his new capital among the Yindus...;x
ireevnttwenty.1;His promises were false! All lies! This was his plan from the start!;x
ireevnttwenty.2;Perhaps the 'Emperor' was just a really lucky madman after all...;x

Even now, his expedition returns to the capital with a mutually beneficial trade deal with the good [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] of [offmap_china.GetFullName]! It seems that our good relations with the son of Heaven will continue even in the Yindu lands.;x
EVTDESCireevnttwentyfive_C;It appears Walakrios and his expedition were not a waste of resources after all! Even now, his expedition returns to the capital with a legendary bounty of loot from deep within the Chinese heartland! The treasures of the Orient flow into our lands.

ireevnttwentyeight.2;Truthfully? An empire to surpass the Saegorian Rome.;x

EVTNAMEireevnttwentynine;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevnttwentynine;The massive [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] army arrives, its forces surrounding the city from all sides. I know this battle will not be an easy one. Should we fail to repel this army, we will certainly be annihilated. Even if we hold them off, I'm not sure how we'll turn the tide against this massive force... Perhaps I didn't think this plan through as much as I thought I did...;x
ireevnttwentynine.1;We hold the walls, no matter what comes.;x
ireevnttwentynine.2;There is a tactic I could employ, but it would undoubtedly cost us the seniores.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirty;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirty;We repel assault after assault, but the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] army is persistent and organized. Their leaders are aggressive and coordinated. We are eventually pushed back to the citadel, and soon even our elite Vieti Seniores are slaughtered to a man. I am eventually forced to hurl myself over the walls to evade capture, shattering one of my legs and fleeing with the few other survivors.;x
EVTDESCireevntthirty_B;We repel assault after assault, making several strategic sacrifices to defend the city. The [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] army is persistent and organized, but ultimately, after losing and reclaiming several districts, a portion of the enemy army is cut down and encircled inside the city. In spite of the heavy casualties we've inflicted, I know we won't be able to fight off the entire army at this rate.;x
ireevntthirty.1;Curse [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]! Curse [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] for abandoning me!;x
ireevntthirty.2;Even then... [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] is clearly on our side.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtythree;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtythree;The war for the Dragon Throne felt like it was doomed to end before it could even begin, yet when all hope seemed lost, a majority of the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] army retreated, seemingly for no reason. Could it be allied reinforcements? Out here? No... Something else... A trap? Why now? They almost had us. Regardless, once the main force was long gone, we sallied out to face our remaining attackers.;x
ireevntthirtythree.1;We were victorious, naturally.;x


EVTNAMEireevntthirtytwo;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtytwo;A mass funeral was held for our fallen soldiers who defended the walls during the siege. Casualties were heavy. The funeral pyres illuminate the field upon which we stand. Within the gathered crowd, my legions gaze stoically into the blazing inferno before them, the silence is deafening, only occasionally broken by the stifled lamentations of the the odd soldier.;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtytwo_B;A mass funeral was held for our fallen legions who charged out during the siege. Casualties were heavy. The funeral pyres illuminate the field upon which we stand. 'You traitor!' A voice from the crowd shouts 'You've sacrificed the heroes of Rome to forge your own despotate!' I turn around, preparing to order their punishment, only to see Julian, staring hatefully towards me.;x
ireevntthirtytwo.1;This trial was only the beginning. Roman blood will drown the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle].;x
ireevntthirtytwo.2;They did as I commanded... What should they have expected?;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtyfour;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtyfour;While trenches are being dug around the city, I receive news from a supposedly trustworthy [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] defector, claiming that the reason for the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] army's premature withdrawal was a number of uprisings in [Root.GetRandomChineseRegion] and several other [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] provinces, devastating the local infrastructure and taxation. Apparently the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle] didn't think we were worth the manpower.;x
ireevntthirtyfour.1;This was their first mistake! Time to go on the offensive.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtyfive;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtyfive;My reinvigorated troops march across China, reinforced by [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] mercenaries and sympathetic peasants. The few [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] armies we encounter are disorganized and damaged, clearly victims of the ongoing civil war. As the Chinese capital grows ever closer, I'm beginning to wonder just what my plan is in this most opportune scenario...;x
ireevntthirtyfive.1;The age of the [offmap_china.GetFullName] will end with my beginning.;x
ireevntthirtyfive.2;We'll take advantage of the chaos, loot what we can, then return home.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtysix;The Civil War;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtysix;We are a week's march away from the capital of [offmap_china.GetFullName]. We've encountered several rival [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] armies, each one vying for regional power. Our goal is simple, take the capital, continue the conquests. I have already taken several strategically located cities. A path into the heart of China has been made clear. I need only to follow it.;x
ireevntthirtysix.1;It will be the seat of this new house of mine.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtyseven;The Civil War;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtyseven;We've reached the capital, and it's quite possibly the perfect storm. Our army now numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Countless other [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] warlords and armies have gathered here today, each one partaking in their own violent series of clashes against each other. I'm watching from a hilltop. The apocalyptic image I see before me is indescribable.;x
ireevntthirtyseven.1;All these grand armies... And only mine will triumph.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtyeight;The Civil War;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtyeight;Countless armies, as far as the horizon. I have not seen numbers this great since the western campaign, or my dreams of old Rome. The palace is close, I need only to swallow my fear and lead my troops in the grand assault. I'll need to use every trick I can in order to win this battle. If I can just get to the palace's defenses in time... Then perhaps victory will be ours.;x
ireevntthirtyeight.1;Roman arms will prevail!;x
ireevntthirtyeight.2;I'll send Cadius and his men on a suicide charge to buy us time.;x
ireevntthirtyeight.3;Now, I come as lightning.;x

EVTNAMEireevntthirtynine;The Eastern Invasion;x
EVTDESCireevntthirtynine;This battle has proven itself to be the ultimate test of our abilities as tacticians and strategists. It seems as though each army is fighting on three separate fronts. Alliances are spontaneously built and shattered in the span of mere minutes. [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] loyalists, regional warlords, provincial rebels, and of course, us. We're steadily moving our force to the imperial pala-*thwack*;x

ireevntthirtynine.1;No! No! I was so close! So close!;x
ireevntthirtynine.2;To the palace! Carpe noctem!;x

EVTNAMEireevntforty;The Imperial Palace;x
EVTDESCireevntforty;As the last of the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] Palace Guards are slain by my men, I walk through the now empty throne room, passing by the seat of power that will soon be mine. While searching for the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress], I soon find myself in a majestic garden. Before me I see a [offmap_china.Ruler.GetGirlWomanBoyMan] in truly fine silk robes, seated in front of a gaming table. I'm taken aback when [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] gestures to me, inviting me over, in perfect Latin no less.;x
ireevntforty.1;Not the reception I expected...;x

EVTNAMEireevntfortyone;The Imperial Palace;x
EVTDESCireevntfortyone;'The end times have come to the doorstep of your palace, and you're in a garden playing board games by yourself?' I scoff at who I quickly realise is the [offmap_china.Ruler.Culture.GetName] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress]. Upon hearing my words, [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSheHe] gives me a faint smile, still looking down at the table with regretful longing. I see no fear in this [offmap_china.Ruler.GetGirlWomanBoyMan]'s eyes. Only regret. The kind of regret I would expect to see from someone on their deathbed.;x
ireevntfortyone.1;You know why I'm here, let's get this over with.;x
ireevntfortyone.2;Perhaps you would like to have one last game, my [offmap_china.Ruler.GetChineseComplimentAdjective] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetTitle]?;x

EVTNAMEireevntfortytwo;The Aftermath;x
EVTDESCireevntfortytwo;I leave the palace garden, with a freshly bloodstained spatha, and a strange feeling of regret. Before me lies a battlefield of a hundred thousand bodies, each one ruthlessly sacrificed in a bid for hegemony over the Middle Kingdom. But they're dead, and I'm not. I am still here. I am still alive. And I am virtually victorious. Vae victis.;x
ireevntfortytwo.1;Vanitas vanitatum. Omnia vanitas.;x
ireevntfortytwo.2;I will rule from the west. The east goes to my [wallyheir.GetSonDaughter].;x
ireevntfortytwo.3;I must consolidate my new reign here.;x

EVTNAMEireevnthektoriosplan;A Proposal from Hektorios;x
EVTDESCireevnthektoriosplan;I'm enjoying a nice cup of tea in the palace garden one day, when Arvid Hektorios approaches me, slamming a map onto the bench and eagerly informing me of his ambitions to travel further west. He hopes to establish an imperial dominion beyond the newly-conquered Indus. I must admit, Hektorios has already made great efforts to see this expedition come to fruition. He's already assembled a sizeable retinue of his own troops, as well as a fleet of his own ships. Though I've learned to be skeptical of the ambitions of my generals, Hektorios has shown himself to be a reliable and loyal sort in the past, always seeking to further the glory and prestige of the empire. He promises that all land that he conquers will be directly integrated into the empire.;x
ireevnthktrios.1;Direct integration you say?;x
ireevnthktrios.2;What a glorious journey he will have! How I envy him.;x
ireevnthktrios.3;No. The barbaric lands beyond the Indus are of no concern to us.;x

EVTNAMEireevntfortythree;Final Preparations;x
EVTDESCireevntfortythree;Our journey to the west is ready to begin. The Emperor of the Romans has given us [red_indo_emperor.GetHerHis] blessing. As we are already celebrating the night before we are to set sail, me and my officers are discussing the details on where exactly our expedition intends to land.;x
ireevntfortythree.1;We can spare ourselves the seasickness by crossing the Indus into Persia.;x
ireevntfortythree.2;Arabia calls! It shall belong to the Romans!;x
ireevntfortythree.3;Naturally, we desire Christian subjects to rule over.;x

EVTDESC_indo_rome_15003;'Aaah, travelers from Daqin!' a military [wallys_chinese_mercenary.GetManWoman] exclaims, emerging alongside a group of soldiers from the trees surrounding our camp. 'I am [wallys_chinese_mercenary.GetTitledFirstName]. We are here to escort my [Root.GetLordLady], the Roman diplomat, to [Root.GetRandomChineseRegion].' [wallys_chinese_mercenary.GetSheHeCap] gestures for [Root.GetHerHis] troops to join my entourage for the evening.;« Oyé, compagnons de voyage ! », s'exclame un[wallys_chinese_mercenary.Get_E] [wallys_chinese_mercenary.GetManWoman] militaire, sorti[wallys_chinese_mercenary.Get_E] du bois entourant notre camp, accompagné[wallys_chinese_mercenary.Get_E] d'un groupe de soldats. « Je suis [wallys_chinese_mercenary.Get_le_TitledFirstName].

'Soy [wallys_chinese_mercenary.GetTitledFirstName]. Estamos aquí para escoltar a mi [Root.GetLordLady] a [Root.GetRandomChineseRegion]'.
